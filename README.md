###1) Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform.

###2) Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using for example Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat  
###3) Node.js uses a Single Threaded Non-blocking strategy to handle asynchronous task. Explain strategies to implement a Node.js based server architecture that still could take advantage of a multi-core Server. 
###4) Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to the testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript + relevant packages  
###5) Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware. 
###6) Explain, using relevant examples, how to implement sessions, and the legal implications of doing this. 
###7) Compare the express strategy toward (server side) templating with the one you used with Java on second semester.
###8) Explain, using a relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express and show how you can "test" all the four CRUD operations programmatically using for example the Request package.  
###9) Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages (Mocha etc.) and how to test asynchronous code. 
###10) Explain, using relevant examples, different ways to mock out databases, HTTP-request etc.
